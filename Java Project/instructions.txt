
THIS IS HOW TO PLAY!

Gravity is always present. If no key is pressed, you will fall to your death. <3

Click "W" to jump; hold down to start flying. Be careful, with great power comes great responsibility.

Use "A" to strafe to the left; Use "D" to strafe right. You cannot extend the game boundaries.

On the easiest level, obstacles will spawn from only the right side. You will start from the left.

On medium level, the obstacles will be moving faster.

On the hard level, the obstacles will spawn from both the left and right side at normal speed. You will start at the center.

On the extra hard level...good luck :D.
